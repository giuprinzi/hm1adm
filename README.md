# hm1adm

In the `hm1adm` repository, you will find the following files:

1. **submissions.pdf**: This PDF file contains all my submissions completed on HackerRank. It includes submissions for both Problem 1 and Problem 2. They are not organized in the order of the problems, because I didn't solved them following their order.

2. **scripts1.py**: This Python script contains my solutions to the exercises for Problem 1.

3. **scripts2.py**: This Python script contains my solutions to the exercises for Problem 2.
